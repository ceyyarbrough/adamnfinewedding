    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Nicole and Chris met during thier Junior year of high school, where they shared both English and US History class. After expectedly awkward first interactions, they went on their first date on April 2nd, 2011 to see the movie LImitless. Which, ultimately coined the sickenly sweet verbage that their relationship would in fact be limitless as well. Which, after enduring both high school and college years, maybe it could be. The day of their fourth anniversary together, they adopted Winston, and they moved into their first apartment together in Greensboro the very next day. Which shows how great at planning they can be sometimes.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Following Nicole's graduation from college, Chris didn't hesitate to move with her to the dreaded Northeast and begin to call Herndon, VA home. This thankfully didn't last long, as they both had their eyes on the Pacific and Nicole jumped at the first opportunity to move the growing pack (as Franklin had now joined in on the adventure) westward to Littleton, CO. There is certainly nothing like two people, two dogs, and a cat moving halfway across the country to make for an interesting few days.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Colorado has been all that they could have dreamed of and more. It has brought new changes, changes in jobs, changes in each other, but ultimately it has borught them closer together. Which is what has led them here, planning their union for August 4th, 2018. A date that so nicely is double their initial anniverary date, which was planned as Nicole loves numbers and their patterns.</p>
    <p class="text_column">And there it is, an incredible oversimplification of the workings that have brought us here. </p>
